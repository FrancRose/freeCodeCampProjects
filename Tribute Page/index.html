		<p id="tribute-info">Charles Michael "Chuck" Schuldiner (May 13, 1967 â€“ December 13, 2001) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He founded the band Death in 1983 and was their lead vocalist until his death in 2001. His obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine said that "Chuck Schuldiner was one of the most significant figures in the history of metal." Schuldiner was ranked No. 10 in Joel McIver's book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists in 2009 and No. 20 in March 2004 Guitar World's "The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists". Schuldiner founded the publishing company Mutilation Music in 1987, affiliated with performance rights organization BMI. Schuldiner died in 2001 after a two-year battle with brain cancer. Schuldiner is often referred to as "The Godfather of death metal", although he was "uncomfortable" with this nickname, remarking that "I don't think I should take the credits for this death metal stuff. I'm just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band." <br><strong> Source: </strong> <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schuldiner" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
