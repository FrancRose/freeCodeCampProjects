			<p>Whether you’re a beginner or guitar virtuoso, learning how to restring your instrument can be a helpful skill. While an electric guitar will need restringing more frequently than an acoustic guitar, restringing a guitar is essential to ensuring proper sound quality.</p>
			<code>Before you jam out or play your love an original ballad, be sure to keep your strings maintained and in tune.</code>

			<p>Keep the area clean so you don’t lose any tools. Similarly, find a quiet area so you can tune your guitar without having to listen to any background noise.</p>
			<p>Gather your equipment. You will need::</p>
				<ul>
					<li>New strings</li>
					<li>Wire Cutter</li>
					<li>A String Winder</li>
					<li>A Tuner</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Depending on whether you’re a beginner or expert, you may not need a tuner if you are a seasoned musician able to tune instruments by ear.</p>
			<code>Choose your guitar strings based on your personal taste</code>

			<p>Balance the neck of your guitar. Find something to secure the neck of your guitar like a special piece of equipment you can buy at a guitar store. If you are a beginner, you can also just use something soft and curved like a piece of polystyrene.</p>
			<p>Loosen the tension of each string with a tuning key and remove. Turn the tuning key and feel the tension loosen for each string. Once loose, unwind the string off of the tuning post and remove</p>
			<p>Remove the bridge pins from out of the bridge. Use the built-in notch of the string-winder to remove each pin. Once the pin is out you can also remove the string from the bridge of the guitar. Secure the ball end of the string against the underside of the bridge to sustain tone. Do not let the ball end sit on the tip of the pin or it will work itself loose.</p>
			<p>Take the string through the tuning post and pull. Tighten the string as you push it about 3 inches through the tuning post. The string should be pulled towards the bridge. About 2 inches from the corresponding machine head, cut the string so that you can poke it through the machine head shaft.</p>
			<p>Wind up the string using a string winder. Tighten the string by using the string winder on the appropriate tuning key but don’t look to tune at this time. Just tighten the string to ensure you have set it correctly.</p>
			<p>Tighten the rest of the strings. Usually, it is best to tighten the strings in the order of:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>6E</li>
					<li>5A</li>
					<li>4D</li>
					<li>3G</li>
					<li>2B</li>
					<li>1e</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Stretch your strings to ensure that they are correctly set.</p>
			<p>Tune your guitar. Most beginners will need to tune their strings several times with a tuning machine. Consult your local music shop if you are having difficulty using a tuning machine.</p>
			<code>Cut any excess string using wire cutters. Loose wire can be dangerous and make it difficult to play your guitar. Cut any excess wire to ensure easy hand movement.</code>

			<p>Ensure your guitar is at a stable position. Use a guitar support for the neck of your guitar as you lay it on a flat and solid surface. If you don’t have a guitar support, place the neck securely against your torso as you unwind the strings.</p>
			<p>Use wire cutters to sever the strings. Create some slack and cut the strings either by the midpoint of the body of your guitar or by the neck pickup. Once cut, remove the string.</p>
			<p>Take the new string and place it through the guitar. In a Gibson style guitar, take the new string through the tailpiece that is underneath the body. For a non-locking Fender-style, thread the new string into the tremolo cavity.</p>
			<p>Make the hole in the post align with the neck. Using the tuning key, turn the hole in the post perpendicular to the neck of your guitar.</p>
			<p>Tighten the string 3 inches from the bridge. As you pull the string, measure approximately 3 inches of slack to allow for winding. Keeping your thumb on the other side of the hole, stop threading the string through the post once it hits your thumb.</p>
			<p>Twist the string in an S shape. Use one hand above the post and the other below it to twist an S around the post. Smoothly twist the string in a clockwise motion. Twist in the opposite direction for high strings on 3 + 3 headstocks.</p>
			<p>Slide the string between the nut and the post. Wrap the part of the string that’s already through the post, around the post and between the excess string between the nut and the post. In other words, take the top part of the S and turn it into a P and place it through the bottom part of the S.</p>
			<p>Create a loop and crimp. Loop the two ends of the string, crimp, and tighten toward the top of the headstock. Tighten and lock the string into place with this technique.</p>
			<p>Use your thumb to anchor the lower part of the string and tighten. Take a string winder and place it on the tuning key. Turn clockwise and, just below the post, use your thumb to feel the string get taught.</p>
			<p>Stretch the strings as you tune. Repeat this process as needed. Use the 5th fret to start this process. Pull the string up with one hand and move up the fretboard with the other. Retune the other frets. The string will give as you stretch. Repeat the process until the string no longer slips.</p>
			<code>Remove excess string with wire cutters once you’re satisfied with the stretching.</code>

			<p><strong>Q: </strong> Could I replace just one string? <strong> A: </strong> You could, but it's best to replace all the strings, especially if they're old. Mixing old strings with new strings, or different types of strings, would likely sound bad/different.</p>
			<p><strong>Q: </strong> How can I tell which guitar string goes where? <strong> A: </strong> If you are playing a right-handed guitar (the fretboard is in your left hand, and you strum with your right hand), the thickest string is on top, closest to you. The thinnest string is the farthest away. If you are playing a left-handed guitar, it's the opposite.</p>
			<p><strong>Q: </strong> How often must we change the strings? <strong> A: </strong> I change mine when they start to lose brightness or feel worn. It all depends on how much you play and whether or not you clean them after use.</p>
			<p><strong>Q: </strong> How do I clean my strings?<strong> A: </strong> Just use a damp rag.</p>
			<p><strong>Q: </strong> Can I have two different types of strings on my guitar?<strong> A: </strong> Yes. It's also good for highlighting certain aspects of your playing. For example, playing a heavy rhythm could require heavier strings, while playing lead could require lighter strings (for bending and such). You could attempt to mix both to create a unique sound.</p>
			<p><strong>Q: </strong> Is there particular way that the strings have to be tied to the knobs?<strong>A:</strong> The string knobs just hold the string in place and do not have to be secured in any particular way.</p>
			<p><strong>Q: </strong> If I can't buy or find the same type of string, what can I use instead?<strong> A: </strong> Use acoustic strings for an acoustic guitar and electric strings for an electric guitar--there really are no good substitutes. Check eBay for cheaper string options.</p>
			<p><strong>Q: </strong> Can I string a regular guitar in revers to play left handed?<strong> A: </strong> No, you would also need to change the nut and setup the saddles on electric for left handed playing</p>
			<code>Never be afraid to ask questions, it's the best way to learn.</code>
